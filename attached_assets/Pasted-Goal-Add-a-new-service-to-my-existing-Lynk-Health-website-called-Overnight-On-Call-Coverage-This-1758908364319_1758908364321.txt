Goal: Add a new service to my existing Lynk Health website called “Overnight On-Call Coverage”. This is a flexible program where our licensed clinicians (nurse practitioners and physicians) provide remote after-hours or nighttime coverage for hospitals, LTACHs, SNFs, and large clinics. It’s broader than just “telehospitalist” — it’s a nocturnist call program for any care setting that needs support during nights or after-hours.

Do not change or remove existing content/features. Chronic Care Management (CCM) and care coordination remain the primary focus elsewhere.

Section: What Is Nocturnist Coverage?
Nocturnist coverage refers to after-hours or overnight clinical support provided by licensed nurse practitioners and physicians who focus specifically on night shifts. Instead of requiring in-house staff to remain on call, facilities can rely on Lynk Health’s remote team to handle admissions, calls, consults, and urgent orders during the night. This reduces burnout for daytime providers and ensures continuous, high-quality patient care.
