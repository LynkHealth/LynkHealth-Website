Perfect—that helps. Here’s a tightened **Replit AI prompt** that bakes the *referral network* + *ongoing remote monitoring/CCM support* into the positioning and copy, while still adding the new page safely without touching the rest of your site.

# 🔧 REPLIT PROMPT — Add “Chronic Wound Management” (Referral Network + Ongoing Monitoring)

**Goal:** Add a new service page to the existing Lynk Health site called **“Chronic Wound Management.”** Tone: we are building a **referral network** that “lynks” providers, patients, and product partners, with **remote monitoring and Chronic Care Management (CCM)** as the backbone for ongoing support. Keep all existing routes/styles/content intact.

## Respect the Current Stack

* Auto-detect framework/routing and reuse shared layout, typography, buttons, and components.
* No breaking changes. Don’t rename or move existing files.

## Create / Update (scoped)

1. **New page route**: `/services/chronic-wound-management` (or match repo convention).
2. **Services index tile/card**: add “Chronic Wound Management” pointing to the new route.
3. **Nav**: if Services dropdown exists, add the new item.
4. **Referral form on-page** (validated server-side):

   * Fields: Referring provider name (req), Organization (req), Role, Email (req), Phone, Patient name (req), DOB (req), Diagnosis/wound type (req), Care setting (Practice, Specialty Clinic, SNF, Hospital, Home Health, Other), Urgency (Routine/Priority/Urgent), Notes.
   * Submit: reuse existing mailer/API if present; else create `/api/referrals/wound-care` (log + email to `hello@lynk.health` if mailer exists) and graceful `mailto:` fallback.
   * Inline success state (no navigation).
   * Analytics: `wound_referral_cta_clicked`, `wound_referral_submitted` (non-PII metadata only).

## SEO (page-scoped)

* Title: **Chronic Wound Management | Lynk Health**
* Meta: **Referral-driven wound program powered by remote monitoring and CCM—coordinating conservative supplies and advanced therapies through our partner network.**
* Use existing OG/Twitter patterns; canonical only if other service pages use it.

## Page Content (use verbatim unless house style forces micro-edits)

**Hero**

* H1: Chronic Wound Management
* Subhead: A referral-first wound care network powered by remote monitoring and CCM—linking providers, patients, and product partners through one coordinated platform.
* Primary CTA: Refer a Patient

**Section: The Problem We Solve**
Chronic wounds demand consistent, longitudinal care. Practices often juggle supplies, advanced therapies, and follow-up without a simple way to keep everyone aligned. The result: delays, complications, and avoidable hospitalizations. **Lynk Health** fixes that by building a **referral network** with **remote monitoring and CCM** at its core.

**Section: Our Referral Network (We’re the “Lynk”)**
With a single referral, Lynk coordinates the entire wound pathway and keeps it connected over time:

* **Care Coordination + CCM Backbone** — Dedicated care managers, monthly CCM touchpoints, structured education, medication and comorbidity support, and closed-loop updates to the referring provider.
* **Remote Monitoring of Wound Progress** — Secure check-ins, photo/measurement capture (where supported), adherence tracking, escalation rules, and summary reports.
* **Conservative Wound Care Products** — Dressings, wraps, and DME delivered fast, with usage guidance and re-supply coordination.
* **Advanced Wound Therapies** — Skin substitutes, grafts, and biologics via our partner network when wounds require escalation.

**Section: How It Works**

1. **Refer** — Submit a secure referral to Lynk.
2. **Assess & Plan** — We coordinate an initial wound assessment and plan of care.
3. **Supply & Educate** — Conservative products shipped with training; adherence reinforced in CCM.
4. **Escalate When Needed** — Non-healing wounds are triaged for advanced therapies through partners.
5. **Monitor & Report** — Ongoing remote monitoring + CCM follow-ups; structured reports to providers; clear escalation pathways.
